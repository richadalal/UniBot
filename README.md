# UniBot

UniBot allows students to get in touch with alumni and other university students to learn more about potential programs.
Students can interact with current students and alumni's through the currently implemented real time messaging option. In the future, a voice call and video call option will be implemented. 

The web application was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript for the user interface. To route the different pages, the Flask framework was used in the back-end and to store the username data, SQLite3 was used.
